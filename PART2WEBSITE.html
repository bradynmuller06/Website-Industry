    <main id="values">
        <h1>My Personal Values</h1>
        <p><em>Hard Work | Adapting | Perseverance</em></p>

        <h2>Hard Working</h2>
        <p>
            Hard work is the foundation of progress and growth. To me, being hard working means 
            showing up every day ready to give consistent effort, even when motivation is low. 
            It’s about developing discipline, pushing through challenges, and staying committed 
            to both short-term goals and long-term dreams. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I value hard work because it builds character and teaches responsibility. 
            It also allows me to take pride in the results of my dedication, 
            knowing that nothing worthwhile comes without effort.
        </p>

        <h2>Adapting</h2>
        <p>
            Adapting means being flexible and open to change. Life rarely goes exactly 
            as planned, and the ability to adjust when unexpected things happen is 
            one of the most valuable skills to have. Whether it’s learning a new 
            skill, facing a sudden challenge, or working with new people, adapting 
            allows me to grow and move forward instead of being held back.
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe that adaptability shows resilience and creativity. It means 
            finding solutions instead of getting stuck on problems. By embracing 
            change rather than resisting it, I can discover new opportunities and 
            keep a positive outlook even in tough times.
        </p>

        <h2>Persevering</h2>
        <p>
            Perseverance is the ability to keep going despite obstacles, failures, 
            or setbacks. To me, it’s about refusing to quit when things get hard 
            and pushing through challenges with determination. Perseverance is not 
            about being perfect — it’s about showing courage and persistence even 
            when the path forward is unclear.
        </p>
        <p>
            I value perseverance because success is rarely immediate. Achievements 
            often come after many attempts, struggles, and lessons learned. Staying 
            determined in the face of difficulty proves that giving up is never an option, 
            and every step forward — no matter how small — matters.
        </p>

    <!-- TESLA SECTION -->
    <main id="tesla">
        <h1>Tesla Industry Overview</h1>

        <h2>About the Industry</h2>
        <p>
            Tesla operates within the electric vehicle (EV) and clean energy industry, 
            a rapidly evolving sector at the forefront of innovation and environmental sustainability. 
            This industry focuses on reducing the world's dependence on fossil fuels by developing 
            electric transportation, large-scale battery storage, and renewable energy systems. 
            Tesla’s contributions extend far beyond cars—its energy division develops solar panels, 
            energy storage solutions like the Powerwall, and grid-scale projects designed to 
            stabilize renewable power sources.
        </p>

        <h2>My Role as a Market Intelligence Analyst</h2>
        <p>
            As a Market Intelligence Analyst at Tesla, my role centers on gathering and interpreting 
            data to support strategic decision-making. This includes analyzing consumer trends, 
            tracking competitor activity, studying global energy policies, and forecasting demand 
            for electric vehicles and battery technology. I collaborate closely with product development 
            and marketing teams to ensure Tesla remains ahead of emerging market shifts. 
        </p>

        <h2>Ethical Issues in My Position</h2>
        <p>
            One significant ethical issue in this role involves maintaining integrity in how market data 
            is collected and reported. Analysts have access to large amounts of sensitive information, 
            and it is essential to ensure that all data is obtained legally and ethically. 
            Transparency, honesty, and adherence to data ethics guidelines are critical to maintaining 
            trust and credibility within the company and industry.
        </p>

        <h2>Cybersecurity Issues in the Organization</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Breaches:</strong> Tesla’s vehicles and customer accounts collect 
            real-time data, including location tracking and autopilot usage. Unauthorized access 
            could endanger customer privacy and company reputation.</li>
            <li><strong>Intellectual Property Theft:</strong> Tesla’s software and AI systems are 
            targets for cyber espionage from competitors and hackers.</li>
            <li><strong>Supply Chain Vulnerabilities:</strong> Attacks on suppliers could indirectly 
            affect Tesla’s production and data integrity.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Cybersecurity Best Practices</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Regular Security Audits</strong> and penetration testing to find weaknesses early.</li>
            <li><strong>Advanced Encryption</strong> to protect sensitive customer and vehicle data.</li>
            <li><strong>Employee Cybersecurity Training</strong> to prevent human error and phishing risks.</li>
            <li><strong>Incident Response Planning</strong> for real-time breach detection and mitigation.</li>
        </ul>
